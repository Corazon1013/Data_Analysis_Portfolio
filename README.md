# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Dimas Tejone Fani! I am a passionate data enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree of Mathematics from Gadjah Mada University. My journey into the world of data began during my time as a student when I embarked on a transformative experience through the Bangkit Academy program. It was during this program that I not only gained valuable knowledge but also had the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world data projects.

In my free time, I thrive on exploring the realms of data analysis and continually expanding my expertise in data analysis tools. I am committed to personal growth and professional development, which is why I engage in courses and hands-on projects that allow me to sharpen my skills and stay at the forefront of this dynamic field.

As a data analyst, I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am dedicated to unearthing meaningful insights from data, driving data-informed decision-making, and translating complex data into actionable strategies.
